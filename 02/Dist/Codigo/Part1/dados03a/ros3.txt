**CombiningMultipleModalitiestoDetectLearner'sInterest

We are interested in combining multiple modalities to detect affect. 
So far, most of the work in affective computing focuses on only a single channel
 of information. This work extends earlier work by incorporating information from
 multiple modalities. The problem is posed as a combination of classifiers in a 
probabilistic framework that naturally explains the concepts of experts and critics.
 Each channel of data has an expert associated that generates the beliefs about the 
correct class using only that modality. Probabilistic models of error and the critics,
 which predict the performance of the individual expert on the current input, are used 
to combine the experts beliefs about the correct class. We demonstrate the multi-sensor
 classification scheme on the task of detecting the affective state of interest in 
children trying to solve a puzzle. The sensory information from the face, the postures
 and the state of the puzzle are combined in a probabilistic framework and we demonstrate
 that this method achieves a much better recognition accuracy than classification based 
on individual channels. Further, the critic-driven averaging , which is a special case 
of the proposed framework, outperforms all the other classifier combination methods 
applied to this problem.


Detection and Analysis of Driver Stress
Driving is an ideal test bed for detecting stress in natural situations. Four types of 
physiological signals (electrocardiogram, electromyogram, respiration, and skin 
conductivity related to autonomic nervous system activation) were collected in a 
natural driving situation under various driving conditions. The occurrence of natural 
stressors was designed into the driving task and validated using driver self-report,
 real-time, third-party observations, and independently coded video records of road 
conditions and facial expression. Features reflecting heart-rate variability derived 
from the adaptive Bayesian spectrum estimation, the rate of skin-conductivity orienting
 responses, and the spectral characteristics of respiration were extracted from the data.
 Initial pattern-recognition results show separation for the three types of driving states: 
rest, city, and highway, and some discrimination within states for cases in which the state
 precedes or follows a difficult turn-around or toll situation. These results yielded from 
89-96 percent accuracy in recognizing stress level. We are currently investigating new, 
advanced means of modeling the driver data.

Gene Expression Data Analysis
This research aims to classify gene expression data sets into different categories,
 such as normal vs. cancer. The main challenge is that thousands of genes are measured
 in the micro-array data, while only a small subset of genes are believed to be relevant
 for disease classification. We have developed a novel approach called "predictive automatic
 relevance determination;" this method brings Bayesian tools to bear on the problem of selecting 
which genes are relevant, and extends our earlier work (with Tom Minka) on the development of
 the "expectation propagation" algorithm. In our simulations, the new method outperforms several
 state-of-the-art methods, including support-vector machines with feature selection and 
relevance-vector machines.

INNER-active Journal
The purpose of the INNER-active Journal system is to provide a way for users to reconstruct
 their emotions around events in their lives, and to see how recall of these events affects 
their physiology. Expressive writing, a task in which the participant is asked to write about
 extremely emotional events, is presented as a means towards story construction. Previous use 
of expressive writing has shown profound benefits for both psychological and physical health.
 In this system, measures of skin conductivity, instantaneous heart rate, and heart stress 
entropy are used as indicators of activities occurring in the body. Users have the ability to 
view these signals after taking part in an expressive writing task.

Moral Sensors
The computer's emerging capacity to communicate an individual's affect raises critical ethical
 concerns. Additionally, designers of perceptual computer systems face moral decisions about
 how the information gathered by computers with sensors can be used. As humans, we have ethical
 considerations that come into play when we observe and report each other's behavior. Computers,
 as they are currently designed, do not employ such ethical considerations. The subject of this 
project will be evaluations that assess the ethical acceptability of perceptual computers. 
The goal is to make a perceptual computer that behaves ethically, in the eyes of its users.
 More specifically, this project will conduct a series of evaluations of systems that mediate 
the communication of affect motivated by different ethical philosophies.

Mouse-Behavior Analysis and Adaptive Relational Agents
The goal of this project is to develop tools to sense and adapt to a user's affective state 
based on his or her mouse behavior. We are developing algorithms to detect frustration level 
for use in usability studies. We are also exploring how more permanent personality characteristics
 and changes in mood are reflected in the user’s mouse behavior. Ultimately, we seek to build 
adaptive relational agents that tailor their interaction with the user based on these sensed affective states.

Pattern Recognition and Learning
This project develops basic theories and tools enabling computers to make inferences from data,
 such as determining a user's affective states. The approach is Bayesian: formulating probabilistic
 models on the basis of domain knowledge and training data, and then performing inference according
 to the rules of probability theory. Bayesian approaches have been implemented in the context of
 curve fitting, mixture-density estimation, principal-components analysis (PCA), automatic 
relevance determination, and spectral analysis. Current work has yielded a Bayesian spectral 
analysis tool for nonstationary and non-evenly sampled signals, such as electrocardiogram 
(EKG) signals, which outperforms other known methods. We have developed a new adaptive Monte 
Carlo method, which can be applied to any generalized linear model and which greatly speeds up
 the sampling process. Additionally, we have proposed a new principled way to combine multiple 
classifiers in a Bayesian framework. Recently, we have developed Bayesian conditional random fields 
for joint classification of structured data, such as sequences, images, and webs.

Personal Heart-Stress Monitor
The saying, "if you can't measure it, you can't manage it" may be appropriate for stress.
 Many people are unaware of their stress level, and of what is good or bad for it. The issue
 is complicated by the fact that while too much stress is unhealthy, a certain amount of 
stress can be healthy as it motivates and energizes. The "right" level varies with temperment,
 task, and other factors, many of which are unknown. There seems to be no data analyzing how
 stress levels vary for the average healthy individual, over day-to-day activities. We would 
like to build a device that helps to gather and present data for improving an individual's 
understanding of both healthy and unhealthy stress in his or her life. The device itself 
should be comfortable and should not increase the user's stress. (It is noteworthy that stress
 monitoring is also important in human-computer interaction for testing new designs.) Currently,
 we are building a new, wireless, stress-mornitoring system by integrating Fitsense's heart-rate
 sensors and Motorola's iDen cell phone with our heart rate variability estimation algorithm.

Posture Recognition Chair
We have developed a system that recognizes posture patterns in real time, in an unobtrusive way,
 from a set of pressure sensors on a chair. This system detects affective states of children in 
learning situations, such as when the child is interested, or is starting to take frequent breaks
 and looking bored. Leaning forward for long periods of time toward a computer screen and taking
 only occasional breaks tends to be a sign of attention (on-task), while slumping in the chair or
 fidgeting suggests boredom (off-task). The system uses pattern recognition techniques, while 
watching natural behaviors, to "learn" what behaviors tend to accompany which states. The system
 thus detects the surface-level behaviors (postures) and their mappings during a learning situation
 in an unobtrusive manner so that they don't interfere with the natural learning process. Through 
the chair, we can reliably detect nine static postures, and four temporal patterns associated with 
affective states.

Robotic Computer
A robotic computer that moves its monitor "head" and "neck," but that has no explicit face, is
 being designed to interact with users in a natural way for applications such as learning, 
rapport-building, interactive teaching, and posture improvement. In all these applications, 
the robot will need to move in subtle ways that express its state and promote appropriate movements 
in the user, but that don't distract or annoy. Toward this goal, we are giving the system the 
ability to recognize subtle expressions as well as the ability to have them.

Sharing Emotions Through Active Expression
The purpose of the Sharing Emotions Through Active Expression (SETAE) system is to help address
 emotional needs and develop emotional understanding. SETAE allows users to reflect actively 
upon the emotions related to their situations through the construction of pictorial narratives.
 Users will be able to gain new knowledge and understanding about themselves and others through
 the exploration of authentic and personal experiences. SETAE employs new, common-sense reasoning
 technology, enabling it to infer affective content from the users' stories. SETAE extracts a 
similar story from the database and displays it to the users, allowing them to hear real stories,
 share their feelings and experiences, and reflect upon these in relation to their personal situations.
 We expect that such reflection can facilitate development of new perspectives on dealing with life’s events.

Wearable Relational Devices for Stress Monitoring
This research aims to build a system for data collection, annotation, and feedback that is part 
of a longer-term research plan to gather data to understand more about stress and physiological 
signals involved in its expression. The first phase consists of building a wearable apparatus for 
gathering data. The challenge here is getting as many accurate labels (annotations) from the user
 as possible, while he or she goes about natural daily activities. The problem is that getting such 
annotations is disruptive, and is itself likely to increase stress, which can interfere with the 
signals being measured, and make users less likely to collect a lot of data. The hypothesis is that
 some ways of interrupting would be less stressful than others. Thus, the second phase focuses on 
implementing different means of interrupting the user for annotations. These ways will be informed 
by prior results on both relational and attentional strategies. Overall, this research should 
contribute not only a new system for gathering annotations useful for studies of stress, but also 
to provide new insights into the value of using relational/attentional strategies in a task that 
involves a large number of interruptions.
